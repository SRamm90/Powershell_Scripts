This Script is built to mass update AD with information (titles, email, address,phone etc etc). Step one is to export AD to csv, then have HR update the csv (ensuring they dont fuck up the column headers ofc), then use this script to import said changes. It worked for me and saved a ton of manual data entry, but its very touchy, and I seem to have lost the script I used to export AD
